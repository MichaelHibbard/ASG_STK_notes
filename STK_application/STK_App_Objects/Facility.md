# Facility
A facility is an [STK_Objects](STK_application/STK_Objects.md) that defines a landmark, a city, etc.

### Inserting a New Facility

To add a new facility, go to "insert -> new" and click "facility". The easiest way to add a facility is to use the "from Standard Object Database". STK maintains a database of known ground facilities or ground sites. 

For selected ground sites, it will include azimuth/elevations masks. These masks define the elevation angle of a satellite required to view the ground site in the azimuth direction. Please refer to the section on [Azimuth-Elevation Masks](STK_application/AzEl_masks.md) for more information.

Below is an example of a facility search:
