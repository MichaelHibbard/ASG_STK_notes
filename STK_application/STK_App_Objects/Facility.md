# Facility
A facility is an [STK_Objects](STK_Objects.md) that defines a landmark, a city, etc.

### Inserting a New Facility

To add a new facility, go to "insert -> new" and click "facility". The easiest way to add a facility is to use the "from Standard Object Database". STK maintains a database of known ground facilities or ground sites. 

For selected ground sites, it will include azimuth/elevations masks. These masks define the elevation angle of a satellite required to view the ground site in the azimuth direction. Please refer to [graticles.blogspot.com/2017/02](graticles.blogspot.com/2017/02) for a nice visualization of azimuth/elevation masks.

Below is an example of a facility search:

Let's pick the first option, White Sands. After clicking insert, we will see it appear on the 2D and 3D maps:
