# Places
A place is an [STK_Objects](STK_application/STK_Objects.md) that defines a landmark, a city, etc.

### Inserting a New Place

To add a new place, go to "insert -> new" and click "place". The easiest method of adding a new place is to select "from city database" on the right-hand side of the window.

From this selection, you can search for the desired place of interest by means of a number of parameters. For example, you could include Austin, Tx:

![](STK_application/STK_application_figures/place_picker.PNG)

which yields

![](STK_application/STK_application_figures/Austin_pic.PNG)

in the 3D pane (it should also appear in the 2D visualization).

Given an internet connection, you can also include a specific place by choosing "pick by address". For example, searching 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue gives the White House.
